# Hi there, you are on _About me_ page!

My name is Chatdanai Lumdee, or 'Tua'. I started my research career when I graduated from the Faculty of Engineering, [Chulalongkorn University](http://www.chula.ac.th/en/) in Thailand with a major in nano engineering. I then took a fellowship from [CREOL/The College of Optics and Photonics](http://www.creol.ucf.edu/) in Orlando, FL to join a PhD program at one of the worldâ€™s foremost institutions for research and education in optics and photonics. At CREOL, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Pieter G. Kik](http://kik.creol.ucf.edu/) where my research focused on optical phenomena at the nanoscale. Upon completion of the degree, I decided to continue my postdoctoral training in another continent and joined the group led by Prof. Alexandre Dmitriev at [the University of Gothenburg](http://www.gu.se/english)/[Chalmers](http://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx) in Sweden. I am currently working on a highly collaborative EU funded project with the aim to develop a technological platform for the next generation of data storage units through nano-optics and nanomagnetism.

I am very enthusiastic in applying my skills and experiences toward creating knowledge-based society driven by research as well as developing and commercialization of advanced photonics-related technologies such as data storage, energy harvesting, photocatalysis, and biomedical devices.
