## Brief journey :)
<!-- <img src="HalfMara.jpg" style="float:right;width:140px;" hspace="10"> -->
My name is Chatdanai Lumdee, or 'Tua'. I am a native Thai grew up in Phitsanulok, a city 400 km to the north of Bangkok. During high school, my sister gave me a book, [The Next Big Thing Is Really Small](https://www.amazon.com/Next-Thing-Really-Small-Nanotechnology/dp/1400046890), which initiated my interest nanoscience. This serves as a reference point leading to my career in the field where I later developed a specialty in nanophotonics.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in Sweden working on projects that combine nanophotonics and magnetism.

I recently grew a keen interest in data science and have conducted several personal projects. Many of those I wrote articles describing the fundamental concept and logic behind -- check them out [here]({{ site.url }}/codes). The projects range from [data analysis]({{ site.url }}/thailand-wages-by-occupation_full-code), [blockchain]({{ site.url }}/blockchain-DIY-with-python), and [recommender systems]({{ site.url }}/recommender-system-with-python). The articles are available only either in English or in Thai (at the moment), but the codes were commented and annotated in English.

More details on my education, careers, and publications can be found in links at the end of this page. Some of presentations I delivered are available [here]({{ site.url }}/science).

## Interests
I am very enthusiastic in applying my skills and experiences toward creating knowledge-based society driven by research as well as developing and commercialization of advanced photonics-related technologies such as data storage, energy harvesting, photocatalysis, and biomedical devices.

As a learning fanatic, I am motivated to develop capabilities and knowledge in areas besides hard-sciences. Those include statistical prediction and big data analysis, machine learning, and blockchain technology.  I am also interested in entrepreneurship where technical expertise can be used to solve problems in everyday life.

## Research careers
It started when I graduated from the Faculty of Engineering, [Chulalongkorn University](http://www.chula.ac.th/en/) in Thailand with a major in nano engineering. I then took a fellowship from [CREOL/The College of Optics and Photonics](http://www.creol.ucf.edu/) in Orlando, FL to join a PhD program at one of the worldâ€™s foremost institutions for research and education in optics and photonics. At CREOL, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Pieter G. Kik](http://kik.creol.ucf.edu/) where my research focused on optical phenomena at the nanoscale. Upon completion of the degree, I decided to continue my postdoctoral training in another continent and joined a group led by [Prof. Alexandre Dmitriev](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uFM2fgcAAAAJ) at [the University of Gothenburg](http://www.gu.se/english)/[Chalmers](http://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx) in Sweden. I am currently working on a highly collaborative [EU project](http://www.physics.gu.se/english/research/femtoterabyte) with the aim to develop a technological platform for the next generation of data storage units through nano-optics and nanomagnetism.
